# Network Switching Study Guides

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of study guides based on a playlist of Barry Smith [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBrFb3pVxnMq07x6weWfNl3fWA34y7BdW). Barry Smith is Program Director for Information Technology at Virginia College Online. The guides cover fundamental networking concepts, including binary numbers, IPv4 addressing, and subnetting. These resources are designed for students, network administrators, and those preparing for certifications such as A+, Network+, Security+, and Cisco CCNA.

## Contents
The repository includes five study guides, each focusing on a specific topic:

- **BinaryNumbersStudyGuide.md**: Explains binary numbers, their importance in computing, and how to convert between binary and decimal using a binary calculator.
- **IPv4AddressingStudyGuide.md**: Covers IPv4 address structure, classes (A, B, C, D, E), public vs. private IPs, network/node IDs, and subnet masks.
- **SubnettingIntroductionStudyGuide.md**: Introduces subnetting, its purpose (security, organization, performance), and the role of routers.
- **SubnettingProcessStudyGuide.md**: Details the six-step subnetting process ("hard way") and the simplified CIDR notation ("easy way").
- **NetworkSwitchingFundamentalsSummary.md**: Summarizes key concepts from all videos, providing a concise reference for binary, IPv4, and subnetting.

## Purpose
These study guides aim to:
- Provide clear, structured notes for learning network switching fundamentals.
- Support preparation for networking certification exams.
- Offer practical examples and analogies (e.g., phone numbers, pizza slices) to simplify complex concepts.

## How to Use
- **Read the Guides**: Start with `BinaryNumbersStudyGuide.md` and progress through the guides in order, as they build on each other.
- **Practice Exercises**: Each guide includes practice exercises to reinforce learning (e.g., binary conversions, subnet calculations).
- **Apply Knowledge**: Use the concepts for real-world network administration or certification exam preparation.
- **Reference the Summary**: Use `NetworkSwitchingFundamentalsSummary.md` for a quick review of all topics.
